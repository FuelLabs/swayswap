# Legal Disclaimer

Read all of this disclaimer before using SwaySwap.

- This software is only for use by _developers_ who understand what the Fuel network is. <https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs>
- You are solely responsible for your use of this demo application ("SwaySwap").
- SwaySwap can't be used to exchange anything of value because it only connects to a "testnet", which only handles essentially fake ETH and other assets that are used for testing applications.
- Do not send anything of value to any of the addresses or smart contracts involved with SwaySwap from any network.
- Although it's difficult to imagine how this test application could cause you any loss or damages, if anything goes wrong it is completely at your risk, and no one will compensate you.
